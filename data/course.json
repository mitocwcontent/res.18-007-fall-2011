  "course_title": "Calculus Revisited: Multivariable Calculus",
  "course_description": "Calculus Revisited is a series of videos and related resources that covers the materials normally found in freshman- and sophomore-level introductory mathematics courses. _Multivariable Calculus_ is the second course in the series, consisting of 26 videos, 4 Study Guides, and a set of Supplementary Notes. The series was first released in 1971 as a way for people to review the essentials of calculus. It is equally valuable for students who are learning calculus for the first time.\n##### About the Instructor\n\nHerb Gross has taught math as senior lecturer at MIT and was the founding math department chair at Bunker Hill Community College. He is the developer of the [Mathematics As A Second Language](http://www.mathasasecondlanguage.org/) website, providing arithmetic and algebra materials to elementary and middle school teachers.\n\n##### Acknowledgements\n\nFunding for this resource was provided by the [Gabriella and Paul Rosenbaum Foundation](http://www.rosenbaum-foundation.org/).\n\n### Other Resources by Herb Gross\n\n[Calculus Revisited: Single Variable Calculus](/courses/res-18-006-calculus-revisited-single-variable-calculus-fall-2010/pages/index.htm)\n\n[Calculus Revisited: Complex Variables, Differential Equations, and Linear Algebra](/resources/res-18-008-calculus-revisited-complex-variables-differential-equations-and-linear-algebra-fall-2011)",
